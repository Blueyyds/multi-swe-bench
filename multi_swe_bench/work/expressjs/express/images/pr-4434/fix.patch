+# Express Charter
+
+## Section 0: Guiding Principles
+
+The Express project is part of the OpenJS Foundation which operates
+transparently, openly, collaboratively, and ethically.
+Project proposals, timelines, and status must not merely be open, but
+also easily visible to outsiders.
+
+## Section 1: Scope
+
+Express is a http web server framework with a simple and expressive API
+which is highly aligned with Node.js core. We aim to be the best in
+class for writing performant, spec compliant, and powerful web servers
+in Node.js. As one of the oldest and most popular web frameworks in
+the ecosystem, we have an important place for new users and experts
+alike.
+
+### 1.1: In-scope
+
+Express is made of many modules spread between three GitHub Orgs:
+
+- [expressjs](http://github.com/expressjs/): Top level middleware and
+  libraries
+- [pillarjs](http://github.com/pillarjs/): Components which make up
+  Express but can also be used for other web frameworks
+- [jshttp](http://github.com/jshttp/): Low level http libraries
+
+### 1.2: Out-of-Scope
+
+Section Intentionally Left Blank
+
+## Section 2: Relationship with OpenJS Foundation CPC.
+
+Technical leadership for the projects within the OpenJS Foundation is
+delegated to the projects through their project charters by the OpenJS
+Cross Project Council (CPC). In the case of the Express project, it is
+delegated to the Express Technical Committee ("TC").
+
+This Technical Committee is in charge of both the day-to-day operations
+of the project, as well as its technical management. This charter can
+be amended by the TC requiring at least two approvals and a minimum two
+week comment period for other TC members or CPC members to object. Any
+changes the CPC wishes to propose will be considered a priority but
+will follow the same process.
+
+### 2.1 Other Formal Project Relationships
+
+Section Intentionally Left Blank
+
+## Section 3: Express Governing Body
+
+The Express project is managed by the Technical Committee ("TC").
+Members can be added to the TC at any time. Any committer can nominate
+another committer to the TC and the TC uses its standard consensus
+seeking process to evaluate whether or not to add this new member.
+Members who do not participate consistently at the level of a majority
+of the other members are expected to resign.
+
+## Section 4: Roles & Responsibilities
+
+The Express TC manages all aspects of both the technical and community
+parts of the project. Members of the TC should attend the regular
+meetings when possible, and be available for discussion of time
+sensitive or important issues.
+
+### Section 4.1 Project Operations & Management
+
+Section Intentionally Left Blank
+
+### Section 4.2: Decision-making, Voting, and/or Elections
+
+The Express TC uses a "consensus seeking" process for issues that are
+escalated to the TC. The group tries to find a resolution that has no
+open objections among TC members. If a consensus cannot be reached
+that has no objections then a majority wins vote is called. It is also
+expected that the majority of decisions made by the TC are via a
+consensus seeking process and that voting is only used as a last-resort.
+
+Resolution may involve returning the issue to committers with
+suggestions on how to move forward towards a consensus. It is not
+expected that a meeting of the TC will resolve all issues on its
+agenda during that meeting and may prefer to continue the discussion
+happening among the committers.

+# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
+
+As a member of the Open JS Foundation, Express has adopted the
+[Contributor Covenant 2.0][cc-20-doc].
+
+If an issue arises and you cannot resolve it directly with the parties
+involved, you can report it to the Express project TC through the following
+email: express-coc@lists.openjsf.org
+
+In addition, the OpenJS Foundation maintains a Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP).
+This is a foundation-wide team established to manage escalation when a reporter
+believes that a report to a member project or the CPC has not been properly
+handled. In order to escalate to the CoCP send an email to
+coc-escalation@lists.openjsf.org.
+
+## Our Pledge
+
+We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
+community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
+size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
+identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
+nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
+orientation.
+
+We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
+diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
+
+## Our Standards
+
+Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
+community include:
+
+* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
+* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
+* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
+* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
+  and learning from the experience
+* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
+  community
+
+Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
+
+* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
+  of any kind
+* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
+* Public or private harassment
+* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
+  without their explicit permission
+* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
+  professional setting
+
+## Enforcement Responsibilities
+
+Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
+acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
+response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
+or harmful.
+
+Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
+comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
+not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for
+moderation decisions when appropriate.
+
+## Scope
+
+This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
+an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
+Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail
+address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
+appointed representative at an online or offline event.
+
+## Enforcement
+
+Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
+reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
+express-coc@lists.openjsf.org. All complaints will be reviewed and
+investigated promptly and fairly.
+
+All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
+reporter of any incident.
+
+## Enforcement Guidelines
+
+Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
+the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:
+
+### 1. Correction
+
+**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
+unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
+
+**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
+clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
+behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
+
+### 2. Warning
+
+**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
+actions.
+
+**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
+interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
+those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
+includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
+like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
+ban.
+
+### 3. Temporary Ban
+
+**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
+sustained inappropriate behavior.
+
+**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
+communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
+private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited
+interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this
+period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
+
+### 4. Permanent Ban
+
+**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
+standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
+individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
+
+**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
+project community.
+

+# Express Triager Guide
+
+## Issue Triage Process
+
+When a new issue or pull request is opened the issue will be labeled with `needs triage`.
+If a triage team member is available they can help make sure all the required information
+is provided. Depending on the issue or PR there are several next labels they can add for further
+classification:
+
+* `needs triage`: This can be kept if the triager is unsure which next steps to take
+* `awaiting more info`: If more info has been requested from the author, apply this label.
+* `question`: User questions that do not appear to be bugs or enhancements.
+* `discuss`: Topics for discussion. Might end in an `enhancement` or `question` label.
+* `bug`: Issues that present a reasonable conviction there is a reproducible bug.
+* `enhancement`: Issues that are found to be a reasonable candidate feature additions.
+
+In all cases, issues may be closed by maintainers if they don't receive a timely response when
+further information is sought, or when additional questions are asked.
+
+## Approaches and Best Practices for getting into triage contributions
+
+Review the organization's [StatusBoard](https://expressjs.github.io/statusboard/),
+pay special attention to these columns: stars, watchers, open issues, and contributors.
+This gives you a general idea about the criticality and health of the repository.
+Pick a few projects based on that criteria, your interests, and skills (existing or aspiring).
+
+Review the project's contribution guideline if present. In a nutshell,
+commit to the community's standards and values. Review the
+documentation, for most of the projects it is just the README.md, and
+make sure you understand the key APIs, semantics, configurations, and use cases.
+
+It might be helpful to write your own test apps to re-affirm your
+understanding of the key functions. This may identify some gaps in
+documentation, record those as they might be good PR's to open.
+Skim through the issue backlog; identify low hanging issues and mostly new ones.
+From those, attempt to recreate issues based on the OP description and
+ask questions if required. No question is a bad question!
+
+## Removal of Triage Role
+
+There are a few cases where members can be removed as triagers:
+
+- Breaking the CoC or project contributor guidelines
+- Abuse or misuse of the role as deemed by the TC
+- Lack of participation for more than 6 months
+
+If any of these happen we will discuss as a part of the triage portion of the regular TC meetings.
+If you have questions feel free to reach out to any of the TC members.
+
+## Other Helpful Hints:
+
+- Everyone is welcome to attend the [Express Technical Committee Meetings](https://github.com/expressjs/discussions#expressjs-tc-meetings), and as a triager, it might help to get a better idea of what's happening with the project.
+- When exploring the module's functionality there are a few helpful steps:
+  - Turn on `DEBUG=*` (see https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) to get detailed log information
+  - It is also a good idea to do live debugging to follow the control flow, try using `node --inspect`
+  - It is a good idea to make at least one pass of reading through the entire source
+- When reviewing the list of open issues there are some common types and suggested actions:
+  - New/unattended issues or simple questions: A good place to start
+  - Hard bugs & ongoing discussions: always feel free to chime in and help
+  - Issues that imply gaps in the documentation: open PRs with changes or help the user to do so
+- For recurring issues, it is helpful to create functional examples to demonstrate (publish as gists or a repo)
+- Review and identify the maintainers. If necessary, at-mention one or more of them if you are unsure what to do
+- Make sure all your interactions are professional, welcoming, and respectful to the parties involved.
